The usage of this work day scheduler is a simple web application where a user has the ability to type plans for their workday and hit the save button to save those plans into the local storage. The work day is broken into 9 hour blocks that are color coordinated to represent time that is past, present and future. The webpage automatically refreshes the time every minute to change the colors accordingly.
